Description: We analyze the amino acid data in animal science where data are repeated measured from each anminal 
             for the small number of sample size. We use three mixed model analyses that capture the time effect,
             while accounting for the correlations of measurements over time from the same steers. First, we allow flexible variance-covariance structures on our model. 
             Second, we use baseline measurements as a covariate in our model. Third, we use percent-change from baseline as a data normalization method.
